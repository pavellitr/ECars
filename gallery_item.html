        Among the reasons for the delay in the release of the Tesla Model X were problems with the gull-wing doors and engine cooling.

        <br>The first to receive the electric car will be buyers who reserved it more than three years ago and made a deposit of 40 thousand dollars. About 25 thousand people have pre-ordered it, the waiting time for deliveries for new buyers is from 8 to 12 months . Tesla expects that half of its future sales will be crossovers .
        
        <br>Tesla Motors plans to expand its audience by women with children and positions the Model X as "the safest SUV ever" and a family electric car for travel (the car can pull a trailer weighing more than two tons) . In general, the segment of expensive SUVs in the United States grew by 17% in August 2015, five times better than the entire automobile market .
        
        <br>In 2016, Tesla Model X will begin to be assembled at the company's European plant in Tilburg, the Netherlands . In the summer of 2017, this electric car appeared in Russia. He was photographed on the streets of Voronezh.
        
        <br>In November 2020, Tesla announced that it would recall 9,136 2016 Model X electric crossovers in the United States. The reason for the recall is defects in the suspension and roof lining.
